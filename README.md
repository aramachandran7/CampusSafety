When in an emergency on a college campus, 63% to 90% of emergency callers don’t know how to describe their location, can’t do it fast enough, and report their location incorrectly.

We wanted to use software to eliminate this problem entirely, not only for NIU but also for any other college, enterprise, or large event. Problems being solved:

- Increases location accuracy
- Provides easy contact with authorities
- Informs users about code of conduct
- Increases student involvement in campus safety
- Aids the Huskie Patrol and campus police
- Our app would ensure that there’s always an easier way to report incidents; that more         incidents will reported; that more students stay safe.

We wanted a streamlined experience, a fluid UI, and a robust backend system that would work every time without question, without inconsistencies.
